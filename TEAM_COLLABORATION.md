## 🔄 Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
main
├── develop
│   ├── feature/ui-components          (Member 1)
│   ├── feature/backend-integration    (Member 2)
│   ├── feature/core-functionality     (Member 3)
│   ├── bugfix/specific-bug-name
│   └── hotfix/critical-fix
```

### Workflow Steps

1. **Start New Feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Daily Development**
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add specific feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Keep Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge develop
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create PR from your feature branch to `develop`
   - Add detailed description of changes
   - Request review from team members
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

5. **After PR Approval**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Formatting changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
feat(auth): add user login functionality
fix(cart): resolve item duplication issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(components): improve button styling
```

## 📋 Development Process

### Daily Standup Structure
1. What did you work on yesterday?
2. What will you work on today?
3. Any blockers or issues?
4. Any dependencies on other team members?

### Code Review Process
1. **Self Review**: Review your own code before creating PR
2. **Peer Review**: At least one team member must review
3. **Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

### Quality Standards
- All code must pass ESLint checks
- Components should be reusable and well-documented
- Proper TypeScript types for all functions and components
- Error handling for all async operations
- Responsive design for all UI components

## 🛠️ Development Setup for Each Member

### Initial Setup (All Members)
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd agri-connect-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up Firebase (Member 2 leads this)
# Follow FIREBASE_SETUP.md

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-assigned-feature
```

### Environment Configuration
Each member should:
1. Set up their own Firebase project for development
2. Create local environment variables
3. Configure development tools (IDE, extensions)
4. Set up device/emulator for testing

---

## 📦 Module Dependencies

### Inter-Team Dependencies
- **UI Components** depend on **Contexts** (Member 1 ↔ Member 2)
- **Core Features** depend on **UI Components** (Member 3 ↔ Member 1)
- **Authentication** affects all screens (Member 2 → All)

### Communication Protocol
- Daily check-ins via team chat
- Weekly video meetings for complex integrations
- Document API contracts before implementation
- Share mockups/wireframes before UI development

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Individual Testing
- **Member 1**: Test UI components in different themes/screen sizes
- **Member 2**: Test Firebase integration and data flow
- **Member 3**: Test feature functionality and user flows

### Integration Testing
- Weekly integration testing sessions
- Test on multiple devices/platforms
- Cross-browser testing for web platform

---

## 📱 Deployment Strategy

### Development Deployment
- Each member maintains their own Expo development build
- Shared development Firebase project for integration testing

### Staging Deployment
- Weekly builds from `develop` branch
- Team testing on staging environment

### Production Deployment
- Monthly releases from `main` branch
- Production Firebase project
- App store deployment coordination
