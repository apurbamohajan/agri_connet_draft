## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Team Members

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apurbamohajan/agri_connet_draft.git
cd agri_connet_draft
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Switch to Your Assigned Branch
```bash
# For Member 1 (UI/UX Developer)
git checkout feature/ui-components

# For Member 2 (Backend Developer)
git checkout feature/backend-integration

# For Member 3 (Features Developer)
git checkout feature/core-functionality
```

#### 4. Read Your Guidelines
Each member should read their specific guidelines file:
- **Member 1**: `MEMBER1_UI_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Member 2**: `MEMBER2_BACKEND_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Member 3**: `MEMBER3_FEATURES_GUIDELINES.md`

#### 5. Start Development
```bash
npm start
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Daily Development Cycle

1. **Start Your Day**
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git pull origin your-feature-branch
   git pull origin develop  # Get latest integration changes
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Work on your assigned files
   - Follow your specific guidelines
   - Test your changes thoroughly

3. **Commit Your Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(area): description of changes"
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Regular Integration**
   - Create pull requests to `develop` branch
   - Request reviews from team members
   - Merge after approval

### Commit Message Convention

Use the conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

Types:
- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Formatting changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- test: Adding tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
feat(ui): add ProductCard component with image support
feat(auth): implement user registration with email verification
feat(cart): add remove item functionality
fix(navigation): resolve deep linking issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### How Branches Work Together

#### UI ↔ Backend Integration
- **Member 1** uses contexts created by **Member 2**
- **Member 2** provides loading/error states for **Member 1**'s components
- Shared TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety

#### Backend ↔ Features Integration
- **Member 3** implements business logic using **Member 2**'s services
- **Member 2** provides API functions for **Member 3**'s features
- Context providers enable state sharing

#### UI ↔ Features Integration
- **Member 3** implements functionality in **Member 1**'s UI components
- **Member 1** creates reusable components for **Member 3**'s features
- Navigation and user flows are coordinated

## 📅 Development Phases
