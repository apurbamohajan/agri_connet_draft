main                           # Production-ready code
├── develop                    # Integration branch
│   ├── feature/ui-components          # Member 1: Frontend Developer
│   ├── feature/backend-integration    # Member 2: Backend Developer  
│   └── feature/core-functionality     # Member 3: Features Developer
```

## 🚀 Steps to Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `agri-connect-app`
4. Description: `AgriConnect - Agricultural Supply Chain Mobile App`
5. Set to **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
6. ❌ **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create Repository"

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agri-connect-app.git

# Push main branch
git push -u origin main

# Push develop branch  
git push origin develop

# Push all feature branches
git push origin feature/ui-components
git push origin feature/backend-integration
git push origin feature/core-functionality
```

### Step 3: Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Branches** in left sidebar
4. Click **Add rule** for branch protection
5. Set up protection for `main`:
   - Branch name pattern: `main`
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Restrict pushes to matching branches
6. Repeat for `develop` branch

### Step 4: Add Team Members
1. Go to **Settings** → **Manage access**
2. Click **Invite a collaborator**
3. Add your 2 team members by username/email
4. Give them **Write** access
